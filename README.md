# Learning Hamiltonian Cycles through drawing!

Welcome to Hamiltonian Cycle Detector, an interactive GUI designed to help you get to know about the Hamiltonian Cycles concept! This is a project we built for our final project in 
Discrete Mathematics class. 

## Getting Started

### How To Install

Simply download all the files and run GraphPanel.java in your IDE to run the program (assuming you already have Java installed).

### How To Use

- Left click to begin creating a node. Name it yourself! The first node labelled by you is the starting node.
- Keep creating other nodes if you like.
- To connect 2 nodes, right click on one and right click again on the other one.
- You can delete a node by holding "D" and left click on it.
- After completing a graph, press "Check Hamiltonian Cycle" to check for if your graph contains a Hamiltonian Cycle.
- You can quickly delete all nodes by pressing "Clear Drawing".
